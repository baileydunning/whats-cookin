## What's Cookin'?

### Abstract

`What's Cookin'` is a paired project developed by 2 Mod2 students at the Turing School of Software and Design. When the user opens the site, they can search/filter the display of all recipes via ingredient or recipe type. When the user clicks `Show Recipe` on any of the cards, a modal pops up that displays the instructions, ingredients needed and total cost of ingredients. A user can then add or remove a recipe to `My Favorites` and/or `What's Cookin'` by clicking the ❤️  or ➕ on any card. When the user is on the `What's Cookin'` page, when they click on a recipe, a shopping list with what ingredients they need for the recipe depending on what is in their pantry will also be shown.
